# CNN_leaf
 A Machine Learning based model built using the concept of Convolutional Neural Network using tensorflow librrary.

 It aims at detecting the disease when you fetch images of potato leaves to the model.

 The model is trained for 50 epochs over a batch size of 32.

 The loss and accuracy plots are attached below along with the sample of predicted plant disease.
