# CNN_leaf
 Presenting a sophisticated Machine Learning model developed using the principles of Convolutional Neural Networks, implemented via the TensorFlow library. This model is designed with the specific purpose of detecting diseases in potato plants by analyzing images of potato leaves.

The model underwent an extensive training process, spanning 50 epochs, with a batch size of 32. The results of this training process, including the loss and accuracy metrics, are depicted in the attached plots. Additionally, a sample of the model's disease predictions is provided for reference.
